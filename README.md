# InsertionSortModified
<h2>What I do</h2>
I ask you for any positive integer and I use that number as the total number of randomn positive integers in an array. After I create the array of random positive integers, I will then sort it! I also print out to a text file each array, so you get a text file containing the pre sorted array, the linearly sorted array, and the binary sorted array.

<h2>How do I sort it?</h2>
I'm glad you asked! I use Insertion Sort. You probably already knew that though. Although I actually sort the array twice! I use Insertion Sort once with a linear search where I check every value linearly for the exact spot I need to put a value down in. I then use Insertion Sort again with a binary search, wherein I check the midpoint of the sorted part of the array and see if I need to move left or right to find the exact spot to put down the value.

<h2>How do you use me?</h2>
To be perfectly honest, I'm not fond of the term "use" in that context but I understand what you're asking. I'm written in c++ and I require at minimum c++11 to be able to run properly. I use the "chrono" library to record time so if you use an older version, I'm afraid I won't compile. Otherwise, you should be able to use any c++ compiler you have on hand to compile and run me. The guy who wrote this used Visual Studios, but if you don't have that, you can install g++ as a way to compile me.

<h2>Do I have bugs?</h2>
I'm sure I do, the guy who wrote me isn't a rocket scientist. But if you follow the instructions to a T, you won't find many defects! Although for any Quality Assurance Engineers out there, that is <b>not</b> an invitiation to break me. That's just rude.

<h2>Anything else?</h2>
Honestly no. I think that's it. Hope you enjoy sorting random positive integers between 1 and 100,000!
